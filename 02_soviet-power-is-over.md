## SOVIET POWER IS OVER

<p align="center">
  From the Soviet Informburo <br/>
  Evening Announcement <br/>
  September 21, 1941
</p>

>    During September 21st, our troops fought the enemy along on the entire front. After many days of fierce fighting, our troops left Kiev.

>  &dash; *Pravda*, September 22, 1941.

Kiev was actually surrendered on September 19th, not September 21st as the announcement states.

I saw them running and I knew it was over. It wasn't common for Red Army soldiers &mdash; looking defensive, burnt-out, some carrying their bedrolls, others already without their guns &mdash; to run through yards and gardens, jumping over fences.

People said that they ran into houses and begged for civilian clothes. Women gave rags to some and they changed their clothes, hoping to hide. The women then drowned the soldiers' now-useless weapons and tunics carrying military insignia in cesspools.

It was very quiet. Fighting had gone on for days, cannons rattling, sirens howling, bombings carried out one after another. At night, the entire horizon was aglow. We slept in knotted tangles in trenches, as the earth shook and fell on our heads.

But now it was quiet &mdash; that silence that seems more terrible than any shooting. And we didn't know where we were: Were we still under Stalin, already under Hitler, or stuck on some narrow island in-between?

The scratching sound of machine gun fire came clear and close from the railway embankment. Small branches and leaves from our old elm fell over our trench. I slammed the hatch down and tumbled into the pit, where my grandfather hissed at me and punched me in the ear.

Our trench, dug in the garden, was a type of anti-aircraft protection typical of those times &mdash; a "slit trench." Dug in the form of the letter *T*, it was two meters deep and seventy meters wide. Courtyards, squares, and streets were dug out with slit trenches like ours. Soviet radio encouraged us to dig them and told us exactly how to do it.

My grandfather and I worked several days perfecting the circuitry. We covered the earthen walls with planks, laid the floor with pieces of bricks, and made a cover for the top. Of course we didn't have enough logs, but we used all of the firewood we found in the barn and added one and a half meters of wood to the top of the trench.

Grandfather looked at it this way: if a bomb fell on our trench,  it would shake the firewood, the logs would scatter like billiard balls and its explosion would never reach us: Where and how would the villainous bomb be able to destroy such a fortress?

For durability, we threw dirt on the firewood, and for disguise we covered it with turf. This gave us an impressive and clearly visible hill, under which, if you lowered the entrance hatch, it was as deaf and dark as the grave.

We were lucky that nothing exploded nearby and a decent-sized piece of shrapnel didn't hit us, because all of this wood would have fallen right on our heads. But we didn't know this yet. We were proud of our handiwork, and we were confident that we were sitting in excellent safety.

Before we'd built this great bomb shelter, Grandpa and I hid from bombs under the bed.

The bed was old, solid, and of good quality, with sheet iron headboards and footboards covered in oil paintings: mills, lakes with swans, and castles. We figured if a bomb hit, it would pierce the roof, then the ceiling, bounce off the spring mattress and featherbed, explode, and the featherbed and two more cotton blankets would of course block any fragments.

To keep us from laying on the bare floor, my grandmother put a blanket and pillows under the bed, so it was very cozy.

And when the shooting started and the windows twitched with the howling of bombers, Grandfather threw himself under the bed first. He would roll away and press against the wall. I'd then roll in, head over heels, and cuddle up against him. And Grandmother, always futzing with the stove 'til the last, would grab Titus the cat and lay at the edge, shielding us with her body &mdash; and thus we'd be safe.

Grandpa whispered prayers and swore at me:

"Oh, *gomon*, why are you wriggling around like you've got a worm inside you?"

After we finished building our powerful trench, we ran into it in the same order, only Grandmother always came running with the pillows and blanket (she wouldn't leave them in the trench to keep them from getting damp).

Titus the cat was used to war; at the first shots, with tail held high, he'd leap straight to the trench's hatch with anguish in his eyes and would meow for us to lower him...because all he knew how to do was climb *up* the steep ladder; he didn't learn to go down.

*Gomon.* I still don't know what that word is. Grandpa died and I forgot to ask him. And the worm of curiosity has always tormented me. I stood outside the trench to watch the planes and see the terrible crosses on them, trying to see how the bombs exploded.

But when the Red Army ran away and it became clear that this was the end, I was afraid to watch. I was finally afraid to watch.

A kerosene lamp burned in the trench, filling it with fumes. My mother, who wasn't there before because she worked at her school day and night, sat on a stool with horror in her eyes. Grandpa ate &mdash; he always ate at our place when he was worried. His gray beard, divided into two wedges, moved abruptly. He didn't chew because of his false teeth, but instead sort of "gummed" (as Grandma would say) and the crumbs fell into his beard. Grandma's praying was barely audible, as she crossed herself in front of the icon of the Mother of God she brought into the trench. I'd put nails in the board myself to hang it up;  I liked this icon, it was my favorite of all my grandmother's icons.

And in the walls behind the boards something rustled quietly, fumbled. And there they lived their personal lives, absolutely indifferent to the war: beetles, worms, and active ants.

The dirt finally stopped quaking and flaking off the ceiling. And in this terrible silence, it seemed like something terrible was about to happen, some kind of unimaginable explosion.

I was just sitting there breathing, waiting for this explosion...

Suddenly, we heard a deaf stomping. The hatch rose, and Elena Pavlovna, a neighbor &mdash; excited and unlike her usual self &mdash; shouted with joy, amazement, and triumph:

"What are you just sitting there for? The Germans are here! Soviet power is over!"

I was 12 years old. This was the first time I'd ever had a lot going on in my life. The Germans, too, were here for the first time. I flew out of the trench first, eyes blinking from the bright light, and noted that the world had become a different place &mdash; like good weather after a storm &mdash; although outwardly, it looked pretty much the same.

Elena Pavlovna, breathless, waved her hands and spoke with love and joy:

"...young, such a young boy stood by! My windows are on the street side. The vehicle left, but he &mdash; so young and so cute &mdash; stayed!"

I immediately ran across the yard, and jumped atop the fence.

At the fence of the square on our Petropavlovskaya Square sat a low, predatory, long-nosed cannon on thick inflated tires. A really young, blond, rosy-cheeked German soldier in an unusually clean and well-fitted grey-green uniform stood nearby. He kept his rifle at the ready and, noticing I was looking at it, straightened up proudly. He made himself look proud in a nice way &mdash; preening. <!--- зафасонил - overstyled? za in this case may mean over? faconil - styled, fashioned, shaped. Using preening. --->

I had a lifelong friend three years older than me, Bolik Kaminsky, I'll tell you more about him later<!--- Make sure there is more about him later, later doesn't appear in the text, but seems to be what is being said here. --->. He was evacuated from the factory worker training school, FZO. Anyway, this German kid looked a lot like my friend Bolik.

You see, I expected it all: that the Germans would be scary giants, perhaps, arriving astride tanks, wearing gas masks and horny helmets, and I was shocked that this kid was so ordinary. Well, he was nothing special, just like our Bolik.

Preening, yeah, I'd be preening, too, if I had a gun like that.

At that moment, the incredible explosion I'd been waiting for happened. I gasped, hit my chin on the fence and almost fell off. And the soldier sat down in disgrace and shrunk, frightened by the blast.

But I have to hand it to him: he immediately came to his senses, got up on his own and started looking somewhere over my head. I turned around and saw the blue sky, beyond the tops of the trees, where pieces of wood fell, spinning and gliding through the air.

"Ach, you blew up the bridge, you damned clods! Eh!" said Grandpa, who approached the fence and stuck out his nose to look at the first German, too.

"Phew-phew, wow! Well, where is Stalin going to fight them, Lord forgive me. It's an army! The Germans aren't *our* unfortunate &mdash; hungry and barefoot. Just look at how he's dressed!"

Indeed, the soldier was dressed perfectly. In newspaper cartoons and in the Soviet films, Germans were depicted as torn-up vagrants and bandits, and the Soviet soldiers were always handsome, fit, and rosy-cheeked.

Вздымая пыль, подлетела угловатая, квадратная и хищная машина, лихо развернулась (мы с дедом жадно смотрели), и такие же подтянутые, ловкие, как фокусники, молодые ребята-немцы прицепили пушку в один миг, повскакали на подножки и, ви­ся по обеим сторонам машины, лихо умчались в сторону Подола.

An angular, boxy and predatory vehicle flew in kicking up dust, turned ominously (my grandfather and I watched eagerly), and as agile as gymnasts, some young German guys pinned the cannon on the truck in an instant, jumped up on the steps and, hanging off both sides of the car, dashingly rushed towards Podil.

"Yes, ah..." said my shocked grandfather, as he did a wide sign of the Cross.

"Glory to you. Oh, my God, I'm out from under that fearful power, and I didn't think I'd live to see it... Go on, help me carry my stuff into the house. It's all wet in the trench. We're really going to live now."

Не весьма охотно поплелся я к окопу. Там мама подавала из темной дыры узлы, чемоданы, табуретки, бабка принимала и складывала в кучу, а я стал носить.

I grudgingly slunk to the trench. There, my mother carried bundles, suitcases, and stools up from the dark hole, and my grandmother piled them into a big heap, and I started carrying them in.

Столько раз за последнее время мы это дело пов­торяли: в окоп, из окопа, вниз, вверх, хоть бы было что порядочное прятать, а то ж одни шмотки на шмотках, какой-то кожух царских времен, в запла­тах, молью съеденный, штаны застиранные, подуш­ки... В общем, занятие не для мужчины.

So many times in the recent past we'd repeated this process: down into the trench, up out of the trench, down, up. At least if there was something decent to hide, or even some good clothes...but it was just patched clothes from tsarist times, moth-eaten, faded pants, and pillows. In general, it was just not a man's job.

My friend Shurka Matza's head poked out from the fence. With huge eyes, he shouted:

"The Germans are on the tram line! Let's go! Let's go!"

And I was blown away like the wind.

The whole Kirillovskaya Street (under Soviet rule it was called Frunze Street, but the name never really stuck) was full of cars and carts from end to end. The cars were angular, with all sorts of projections, grilles, and brackets.

Every vehicle has a face, it looks at the world with its headlights indifferently, or angry, or grievously, or surprised. So these guys, like the first one that carted the cannon away, were watching the carnage. I hadn't seen such vehicles in my life, and it seemed to me that they were very powerful, they filled the street with roar and smoke.

Кузова некоторых грузовиков представляли собой целые маленькие квартиры, с койками, привинчен­ными столами.

The insides of some of these trucks contained entire small apartments, with bunks and screwed-in tables.

Немцы выглядывали из машин, прогуливались по улице — чисто выбритые, свежие и очень веселые. Будешь свежим и веселым, если у них пехота, ока­зывается, не шла, а — ехала! Они смеялись по лю­бому поводу, что-то шутливо кричали первым вы­ползающим на улицу жителям. Между фурами со снарядами и мешками лихо юлили мужественные мотоциклисты в касках, с укрепленными на рулях пулеметами.

The Germans looked out of vehicles and walked down the street &mdash; clean-shaven, fresh, and very cheerful. You'd be fresh and cheerful, too, if you did not go on foot, but rode! They were laughing about everything, screaming jokingly at the first people crawling out on the street. Courageous motorcyclists in helmets with machine guns on their handlebars were dashingly jockeying between the vehicles, hauling shells and bags.

Доселе нами невиданные, огромнейшие, огненно-рыжие кони-тяжеловозы, с гривами соломенного цвета, медлительно и важно ступая мохнатыми но­гами, запряженные шестерками, тянули орудия, будто играючи. Наши малорослые русские лошаден­ки, измордованные и полудохлые, на которых отсту­пала Красная Армия, показались бы жеребятами рядом с этими гигантами.

The largest, fiery red heavy-duty horses with straw-colored manes &mdash; the likes of which we had never seen before &mdash; slowly and importantly stepped with furry legs, harnessed in sixes. They pulled cannons as if they were toys. Our small Russian horses, exhausted and half-dead carrying our retreating Red Army would look like foals next to these giants.

В ослепительных белых и черных лимузинах еха­ли, весело беседуя, офицеры в высоких картузах с серебром. У нас с Шуркой разбежались глаза и за­хватило . Мы отважились перебежать ули­цу. Тротуар быстро наполнялся, люди бежали со всех сторон, и все они, как и мы, смотрели на эту армаду потрясенно, начинали улыбаться немцам, в ответ и пробовать заговаривать с ними.

In the dazzling black and white limousines, officers with tall hats with silver cords drove, having a fun conversation. Shurka and I were paralyzed by our dazzled eyes. We steeled ourselves and ran across the street. The sidewalk filled quickly, people ran from all sides, and all of them, like us, looked at this armada in shock. The Germans began to smile in response and try to talk to them.

А у немцев, почти у всех, были книжечки-разго­ворники, они листали их и кричали девушкам на тротуаре:

And almost all of the Germans had German-Russian translation books. They flipped through them and shouted to the girls on the sidewalk:

  — Панэнка, дэвушка! Болшовик — конэц. Ук­райна !

"Young ladies, girls! Bolshevik over. Ukrayna!"


— Украина, — смеясь, поправили девушки.

"Ukra*i*na," the girls laughingly corrected.


— Йа, йа! У-край-ина! Ходит гулят шпацирен битте!

"Ya, ya! You-krai-eena! Come walk spazieren bitte!"


Девчонки захихикали, смущаясь, и все вокруг по­смеивались и улыбались.

The girls giggled, embarrassed, and everyone laughed and smiled.


От Бондарского переулка образовалось какое-то движение: видно было, как торжественно плывут головы, и вышла процессия стариков и старух.

From Bondarsky Lane came some movement: these floating solemn heads became visible, a procession of elderly men and women.

Пе­редний старик, с полотенцем через плечо, нес на подносе круглый украинский хлеб с солонкой на нем. Толпа повалила на зрелище, затолкались.

The old man in front, with a towel over his shoulder, carried Ukrainian bread on a tray with a salt shaker. The crowd gathered close for the spectacle, pushed and got stuck.

Старики опоздали и растерялись: кому вручать?

The old men were late and confused: to whom to hand the bread?

Передний двинулся к ближайшему белому лимузи­ну, откуда, улыбаясь, смотрели офицеры, и с пок­лоном подал поднос. Мы с Шуркой потеряли друг друга. Я изо всех сил пытался протиснуться. Там что-то говорили, грохнул смех, задние спрашивали: «Что он сказал? Что он сказал?» — но колонна дви­нулась дальше, я только увидел, как в проезжаю­щем автомобиле офицер передавал хлеб с полотен­цем на заднее сиденье.

The old man advanced to the nearest white limousine, where the officers were smiling, and he bowed down and served the tray. Shurka and I lost each other. I tried my best to squeeze myself through the crowd. They said something, laughed and the back of the crowd asked, "What did he say? What did he say?" But the column moved on and I saw an officer hand over the bread and towel to the back seat of a passing car.

Вокруг стали говорить, что где-то тут немцы кри­чали: «Масло, булки!» — и сбросили прямо на трам­вайную линию ящик с маслом и корзины с бул­ками — бери, мол, кто хочешь. Я заметался, пытаясь понять, где это, и побежал к мосту над Вышгородской улицей.

Around that time, talk began that somewhere nearby the Germans shouted, "Butter, rolls!" and dumped a crate of butter and baskets of rolls right onto the tram line. I darted back and forth, trying to figure out where it was, and I ran to the bridge over Vyshhorodska Street.

У моста масла и булок не оказалось, но был по­жар. Угловой кирпичный дом горел спокойно и ле­ниво, подожженный влетевшим в окно снарядом. За­бор уже свалили прямо на росшие у дома цветы, по ним топтались. Две женщины и девочка лопатами копали землю и кидали на огонь, потому что воды не было. Из толпы зевак вышел мужчина, взял пал­ку и стал безжалостно бить стекла в окне.

The bridge didn't have any butter or rolls, but there was a fire. The brick house on the corner burned quietly and lazily, set alight by a shell flying through its window. The fence had already been piled right onto the house, and the flowers growing around the house were stomped on. Two women and a girl used spades to dig up the ground and threw the dirt on the fire because there was no water. A man emerged out of the crowd of gawkers, grabbed a stick and began to ruthlessly smash the glass in the window.

Немец спрыгнул с машины, прицелился фотоап­паратом, приседал и выгибался, снимая пожар круп­ным и общим планом.

A German jumped off his vehicle, took aim with his camera, squatted down, and took both close-up and wide-angled photos of the fire.

Мужчина полез в окно и стал подавать женщинам стулья, ящики с бельем из шкафа, вышвыривал пальто и платья, и все его хвалили, и я тоже поду­мал: какой молодец!

The man who'd smashed the window climbed out of it and started handing chairs to assembled women, throwing out coats and dresses and boxes of linens from the closet. Everybody praised him and even I thought: what a great guy!

Войска продолжали тучей валить из-под моста. Ярко светило солнце, не было никакой пальбы — только рев моторов, грохот колес, голоса, смех. Пос­ле долгого сидения в яме я совсем одурел от всего этого; пошатываясь, побрел домой отчитываться.

Troops kept coming out from under the bridge. The sun shone brightly, and there was no shooting &mdash; just the roar of engines, the rumbling of wheels, the voices, the laughter. After sitting in the trench for such a long time, I was completely amazed by all this; staggering, I went home to report back.


А у нас во дворе стоял серо-зеленый солдат с ружьем через плечо и с веревкой в руках — прос­тецкий такой, с белесыми ресницами и красным лбом, равнодушно поглядывал по сторонам, а дед, жестикулируя, приглашал его в сарай:

And in our yard there was a soldier in gray-green with a gun slung over his shoulder and a rope in his hands. A simple man with white eyelashes and a red forehead, indifferently looking around. My grandfather, gesticulating, invited him to the barn:

— Тут ниц, ниц, ниц, а там, может быть, ист! Надо посмотреть, битте. Солдат неохотно поплелся в сарайчик.

"There, nichts, nichts, nichts, and there, maybe, ist! Need to look, bitte."

The soldier reluctantly trudged to the barn.

— Они пленных ищут, — сказала мне бабка с крыльца.

"They're looking for prisoners," said my grandmother from the porch.

В сарае был люк в погребок. Солдат стал показы­вать руками:

There was a cellar hatch in the barn. The soldier began to show his hands:

"Matshes, mastches."

Дали ему спички. Он зажег и осторожно заглянул в дыру.

We gave him some matches. He lit one up and looked carefully into the hole.

— Партизан! — громко и иронически сказала бабка.

"Partisan!" Grandma shouted, loudly and ironically.

Солдат отпрыгнул, как ужаленный, вертя голо­вой и подозрительно глядя на всех нас.

The soldier jumped like he'd been stung, spinning his head around and looking suspiciously us all.

— Я смеюсь, — сказала бабка, — иди, иди, не бой­ся. Нет партизан.

"I'm joking," said Grandma. "Go, go, don't be afraid. No partisans."

Но солдат что-то недовольно сказал, в погреб лезть не захотел, а строго показал деду на красный домовый флаг, который мы по праздникам должны были вывешивать на воротах.

But the soldier grumbled in displeasure and said he didn't want to go into the cellar, but instead pointed out the red house flag we hung for holidays to Grandfather.

"That."

— Да, да, — засуетился дед, взял флаг и оторвал от древка. — Марфа, скорей кинь в печку. А палка хорошая, на метлу пойдет.

"Yes, yes," Grandpa went over, grabbed the flag and tore it off the shaft. "Marfa, hurry up and throw it in the oven. It's a good stick, it'll go on a broom."

Пришел другой солдат, тоже с веревкой, возбуж­денно кликнул первого, и они побежали. Бабка по­манила меня в сени.

Another soldier &mdash; also carrying a rope &mdash; showed up, excitedly called over to the first one, and they ran off together. Grandma lured me into the house and handed me the flag.

— На, полезь на чердак, засунь там, в газету ка­кую-нибудь заверни.

"Here, wrap this in newspaper and hide it in the loft."

— Да на что он, бабка?

"What for, Grandma?"

— Никто ничего не знает, сынок... Да и у немцев вон красные флаги, велят цеплять — опять новую материю покупай. Делай, сынок, как я говорю.

"Nobody knows anything, son. And the Germans have red flags, too, and they'll tell us to put them up and we'll have to buy a new one again. Do as I say, son."

Я понял. Полез на чердак, пробрался по-пластунски в дальний угол, затискал сверток под балку, а когда, наевшись паутины, спустился, бабка стояла в воротах с Еленой Павловной и звала:

I got it. I climbed into the loft, snuck into the far corner, shoved the bundle under the beam, and when, after having eaten a cobweb, I went back down, my grandmother stood at the gate with Elena Pavlovna and called:

— Старый! Иди быстро, партизана ведут.

"Old man! Come quickly, the partisans are caught!"

Наш краснолобый солдат вел по улице здоровен­ного грязного кабана, захлестнув его веревкой по­перек туловища, другой подгонял хворостиной, и вокруг шли еще другие солдаты кучкой, удовлетво­ренно голготали.

Our red-skinned soldier led a huge dirty wild boar down the street, pulling it by a rope looped around its belly, while another soldier drove it forward with a twig. A bunch of other soldiers walked around them, self-satisfied.

Делая большие глаза и ахая, Елена Павловна рас­сказывала, что солдаты совсем не пленных ищут, а... грабят. И у Каминских взяли кабана, и кожухи тащат, а у нее заглядывали в шкаф, под кровать, сняли с подушек наволочки и зачем-то полотенце с гвоздика. Сосед не хотел отдать кабана, так они ос­тавили расписку, сказав: «Официр плати». Нам, вы­ходит, повезло, если ничего не взяли, может, оттого, что дед немецкие слова говорил, они постеснялись.

Eyes wide, Elena Pavlovna exclaimed that soldiers weren't looking for prisoners at all...they were looting. They took the Kaminskys' wild boar, dragged out sheepskin coats, and they looked in the closet, under the bed, removed pillowcases from pillows and took the pillowcases, and for some reason, a towel embroidered with carnations. The neighbor didn't want to give up the boar, so the Germans left a receipt saying: "Officer pay." We were lucky they didn't take anything from us, maybe they hesitated because Grandfather said a few words in German.

Дед озабоченно посмотрел вслед мужественной во­оруженной процессии с кабаном.

Grandfather watched the brave armed wild boar procession anxiously.

— А ну, — строго сказал он, — давайте носить вещи обратно в окоп. Трясця его матери, я и забыл, это же их право победителя: три дня грабить все, что хотят!

"Come on," he said strictly, "Let's bring things back to the trench. Shake their mothers, I forgot, it's the winner's spoils: three days to loot whatever they want!"

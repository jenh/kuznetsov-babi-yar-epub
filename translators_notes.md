# Translator's Notes

I came to this project out of compulsion; found in a used book store after a Wharton phase. That the book is out of print and no digital version of such an important work.

I am not a Russian speaker. How I translated it is this:

lib.ru

Machine translation using Mort Yao's translate-shell utility at [githublink](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/blob/develop/README.md). I first ran portions through using Microsoft's Bing as it produced the cleanest Russian version followed by English version of the engines I looked at. Then, paragraph by paragraph, I used the following engines to compare meaning: Google, Deepl, Yandex. I found Deepl the best as it provided multiple options. I then edited for sound and sense and readability, but took care not to change any meaning...

I hope most that I have done Anatoly's work justice and that his words -- and facts -- can be shared more widely.


Thank yous to:

# Translator's Notes

I came to this project out of compulsion; found in a used book store after a William Wharton phase. That the book is out of print and no digital version of such an important work.

I am not a Russian speaker. How I translated it is this:

lib.ru

Machine translation using Mort Yao's translate-shell utility at [githublink](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/blob/develop/README.md). I first ran portions through using Microsoft's Bing as it produced the cleanest Russian version followed by English version of the engines I looked at.
Then, paragraph by paragraph, I used the following engines to compare meaning: Google, Deepl, Yandex. I found Deepl the best as it provided multiple options. I then edited for sound and sense and readability, but took care not to change any meaning...

I used https://context.reverso.net/translation/russian-english/ to help with context in certain situations.

After the first chapter, I cut everything into 150 line files and used a simple script to feed it line by line into automated translation; this way, I could print the original text and the translation into a single file to work with without any extra characters. (trans with -b)

I hope most that I have done Anatoly's work justice and that his words -- and facts -- can be shared more widely.


Thank yous to:

There was an entire section missing from the Dotan OCR. To resolve, I was able to locate a PDF of the book in Russian, then OCRed and translated the missing sections. Tried a bunch of apps - but best one was Govarthani Rajesh - Text Scanner (OCR)

David Floyd, the original translator, with whom Kuznetsov immediately contacted for help when he escaped from his escort in London...was revealed as a Soviet spy! According to this, passed information from 1944-1947 when he worked in Moscow as a diplomat. He fully confessed and later went to work with the Telegraph.

> David Floyd: the traitor who was forgiven and forgotten
David Floyd had been an avowed student communist yet still landed a job at three British embassies during the Cold War — and another at The Daily Telegraph as the Foreign Office covered up his spying

> In the margins of a top secret Foreign Office document dated July 19, 1951, Britain’s then foreign secretary, Herbert Morrison, scribbled a despairing note: “Why must we employ such doubtfuls?” It was only a few weeks after the Cambridge spies Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean had disappeared, turning up later in Moscow.

> Now the Foreign Office had learnt another of its young diplomats whose compromising past had been overlooked had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union. This time it was an Oxford graduate who admitted passing secrets to Russian intelligence agents when he worked in Moscow at the UK military mission and the British embassy from 1944 to 1947.

> The diplomat’s name was David Floyd and, if the fate that befell Burgess and Maclean…

Profumo affair...

Kuznetsov started documenting when he was 14, but he wrote the book itself in the summer of 1965 -- while the Soviet government was bulldozing the site in order to build a new stadium and amusement park.

## Looting is Damned Interesting, But You've Got to Know How

Our neighbor took the receipt up to the school, where the Germans had already set up their headquarters. I immediately chased after him, thinking: they'll give him German money, and I can ask him to see it.

I waited at the gate of the school. He stood there, in the courtyard, explaining the situation as he walked up to the door. Then I saw him fly out of it with a crash, waving his arms ridiculously. The soldiers shouted and unbolted their rifles. I was afraid they'd shoot and ran around the corner.

The troops still marched through the area, but there were fewer than before. From the vicinity of the bazaar, people ran in all directions and scattered like cockroaches, loaded down with stuffed sacks, faces flushed with excitement. Realizing that I was clearly missing out, I rushed to the bazaar.

I encountered a group robbing a large shoe shop. They'd smashed the showcase window, and people buzzed around it, busily elbowing each other, crunching the glass underfoot, aunties and uncles climbing all over each other. I rushed after them and managed to see them grab boxes of shoes and galoshes. My God, what fabulous goods they were for that time! But while I made my way there, the shelves emptied as if they were swept clean by the wind and the crowd boiled over into a corner. I stopped and jumped on other people's backs, annoyed: Well, that's it then, everything is right there in front of my eyes, but I canâ€™t reach it. Friends and lovers were already ripping bundles of shoelaces and boxes of shoe polish from each others' hands.

Then I jumped through the window and back onto the street, looking around: Is there another, unlooted store? Oh, what a shame: While I was tossed about in the shoe store, the hardware store next to it had been broken into and people were already dragging out paint cans, bundles of shovels, and locks.

I dashed in, working my elbows, and squeezed up to the counter, but all I saw were legs and feet trampling over scattered chalk and putty. I noticed the men knocking to get into the back room and climbed over with them, got in through the door and was hit on my head and in the teeth. I was brutalized from the pain and fled, wedging myself between two men who squeezed me so tightly that my ribs crunched...but there, right in front of me, appeared a broken box.

A new kerosene lamp without its glass covering lay in the box, cradled in straw. I reached out, pushing away alien hands, and grabbed one, then another &emdash; and then the rest of the lamps were gone.

I trembled, realizing that this was the sum of my loot. But the store was empty, and the robbers ran on. I ran out and almost roared: They'd already broken into the haberdashery, and it was untouched when I arrived. It appeared to have been robbed by squealing women, and the shop was quaking.

At this point I, like a writhing little beast, made my way there and grabbed a box off the shelf. The women tried to pull it from me, but I clung to it like a cat to meat. They really shook the soul out of me, the wooden box cracked, and basic black coat buttons fell from it. Dozens of hands began to rake through the buttons, and I frantically raked and poured them into my pockets, too, because I had more right to them than all the others.

I noticed clothes brushes rolling under my feet and began to grab at them, fishing out five of them. But in the process, I dropped a lamp, which was immediately snatched out from under my nose by some vile woman.

Crushed, I swayed, and went outside, where I caught sight of bags of salt being dragged out of a store, but when I got closer, I saw that only paper and empty crates were left.

I was ready to cry. I'd never been greedy &emdash; my grandmother taught me to be a well-mannered and polite grandson &emdash; but suddenly this robbery seized me like a hot avalanche, and I was choked with greed and excitement.

And, most importantly, I understood that this was a unique, rare case &emdash; so rich, so magnificent, such robbing with impunity. I missed the opportunity, I was a little late...due to a lack of experience. "Well, okay," I thought, comforting myself. "But next time..." But when would there be a next time?

Overcome with grief, I gathered some weights from the scales on the counter and carried all of my loot home.

From the windows, people were peeping at their front gates. Our neighbor Pavel Sochava yelled ironically to the entire street:

"Here comes Tolya home from robbing. Go tell your mother to whip you!"

I felt like cold water had been poured over me. I proudly carried my lamp and brushes, and then I slipped into the yard, unloaded my loot in the hay...and Mom gasped:

"What the hell is this?"

Grandma looked at it and shook her head:

"But don't we have a lamp, son?"

But my grandfather understood me and praised me:

"Here we go! Well done! The Bolsheviks themselves robbed our people and sold it back to us, so it's ours anyway. Ach, I didn't know, I missed it, ach, I missed it! Shatkovsky there has taken out half the deli and rolled out a barrel of sunflower oil. What an occasion! We're the only ones who get robbed here."

It turned out that when I was at the bazaar, six soldiers came and demanded, "Eggs, milk!"

"They crawled everywhere through the house, taking potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes...Well, hell, look what's going on. Some people are robbing there, others are robbing there. It's business!"

I was still shaking with excitement and my grandfather's praise, I ran to shout for Shurka Matsa and we both went back to the market. It was already empty. No matter how much we looked, nothing. The stores had been swept clean as if by broom &emdash; covered only with paper, straw and glass. In the shoe store, we climbed up to the register and started turning the handle. We pulled out checks for thousands of roubles, went outside, threw them in the street and, already indifferent, watched as the troops entered the city.

There were tractors, all-terrain vehicles, columns of soldiers riding bicycles, and wagons on simple carts. The troops that entered wore knots of junk slung over their coats.

The wind rose, drove the straw and paper, carried smoke from the cars, the armies went on, gliding like a cloud, and there was no end to them. Everything was in order, and like locusts, they'd taken everything they could grab. A quiet, seemingly normal, prosaic robbery...It was Friday, September 19, 1941.

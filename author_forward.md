I brought the original manuscript of this book to the Russian literary magazine *Yunost* (*Youth*) in 1965. They returned it to me immediately &mdash; in horror &mdash; and advised me not to show it to anyone until I removed the "anti-Soviet" content from the text.

I removed important sections from of the chapters about the Khreshchatyk, the explosion of the Kiev Monastery of the Caves, the catastrophe of 1961 and more &mdash; and officially introduced a softened version of the book in which some details were obscured, but still could be guessed.

At the time, it seemed to many that a serious liberalization was beginning and Krushchev's "exposting the cult of Stalin's personality" was still fresh. The publication of "One Day of Ivan Denisovich" by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn gave us hope that, finally, true Literature might be possible.

But the softened version of my "Babi Yar" again puzzled the editors. The manuscript was snapped up, everyone read it and enthusiastically responded in private conversation, but officially, they shared murderous criticism. The editors did not dare publish without special permission; in the Soviet language, this is called: "We should consult with higher comrades."

The manuscript went up the chain &mdash; to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, where it was read (but without a number of chapters), as I was told, by Suslov (the Second Secretary of the Central Committee), and he generally allowed publication. The editors' clever argument that sealed the deal with the "upline comrades" was that my book allegedly refutes the famous poem by Yevtushenko about Babi Yar, which caused great scandal and noise when it was published.

But no, of course I didn't refute this magnificent poem. Moreover, Yevtushenko, a friend with whom I studied at the same institute, actually conceived his poem on a day we went together to Babi Yar. We stood over a steep cliff, and I told him from where and how people were driven, how the stream washed their bones, how there was a struggle to build a monument, which was not to be.

["No monument stands over Babi Yar,"](http://remember.org/witness/babiyar) -Yevtushenko said thoughtfully, and there I learned this first line of his poem. I am not opposed to his book; it's just that the size of the novel allowed to tell much more about Babi Yar and all of its aspects. In some foreign editions of my novel, instead of the preface, they published a poem by Yevtushenko that speaks for itself.

One way or another, the book was published, but since the Central Committee read and approved it without a number of chapters, these were the first chapters to be removed. Then the Editor-in-Chief of *Youth,* Boris Polevoy, Leopold Zheleznov, executive secretary, and many other people have made so many notes, changes, and markups that sometimes behind their multicolored corrections, there was no text left.

With great difficulty the book managed to keep its name, despite the categorical demand to change it ("so as not to evoke memories of Yevtushenko's poem"). However, all critical mentions of Stalin were carefully removed ("the opinion is that now is not the time") as well as, in general, the slightest criticism of something Soviet ("An anti-fascist novel, criticize only Hitler's regime").

It literally came down to a joke. At the beginning of the novel,there's a phrase about the Germans having huge, heavy-duty red horses, before which the horses on which the Red Army retreated appeared to be foals. The phrase was immediately deleted. I argued that at the end of the book I describe how the Germans retreat from our undersized horses, because their red-haired heavy-duty trucks couldn't stand against. B. Pelevoy objected: "While the reader is reading, he will forget the beginning, and will only remember that the Germans had better horses than we have." After desperate disputes and general discussions, the phrase was left in a softened form, but it was hardly the only exception.

I wrote about an abandoned tank, for example:

"This tank was the perfect toy for the village children." They crossed this out with question marks and swearing: in this phrase, it turns out, there is a terrible sedition &mdash; pacifism. "We are not spineless pacifists, we cannot teach young people to disrespect tanks."

Or I dared to ridicule unsuitable military wagons, which, "God save the war, are not suitable to travel" &mdash; it was crossed out, as directly anti-Soviet, with some pathological hatred. And there's no way to prove anything, and there's no way to defend a single word. It goes without saying that chapters such as "Cannibals" or "Burned Books" were crossed out with a single stroke, and could not even be discussed. The novel has three chapters under the same title "Burned Books" &mdash; first books burned in 1937 during Stalin's purges, then they were burned in 1942 under the Germans, and finally in 1946 after Zhdanov's speech. Only the middle chapter was left, the books burned by the Germans.

I argued desperately, proving that I critically described the abuses of the personality cult, which was condemned. I was given objections like this: "The Party has condemned enough. And there's nothing further to write about it." And when there was no argument, with the doors tightly closed, they meaningfully told me:

"They're not letting us in on this, okay?"

"Who are they? I asked, "Let me talk to them, and I'll be able to persuade them." But there is a rule: never, under no circumstances allow an author contact with a professional censor. And as much as I have tried, I have never been able to see the mysterious "they" and do not know their names.

All of my previous works, as well as those of the writers I knew, were reworked beyond recognition. We tried to read each other's works in unpublished manuscripts, because the difference was huge.

Writers in the USSR always faced this dilemma: either print at least what censorship allows, or don't print at all. Many believe that it is better to bring the reader something than nothing. I thought so, too. I corresponded with Solzhenitsyn on this subject, I told him how my work was disfigured by censorship and despite my desperate resistance, the censor achieved his goal, and my books came out into the world as freaks, and I found myself becoming hateful. Solzhenitsyn wrote that it is possible and necessary to make reasonable concessions to censorship, but to a certain limit, obviously.

When I saw that a quarter of the most important text was thrown out of "Babi Yar," and the meaning of the novel was turned upside down, I said I refused to publish and demanded the manuscript back.

That's where something quite unexpected happened. The manuscript was not returned. As if I was no longer her master. Remember Solzhenitsyn's statements about having no control over his manuscripts? So, by giving the manuscript to the editors, I couldn't get it back. It culminated in this wild scene in B. Polevoy's office, with all of the editorial staff gathered, where I demanded the manuscript back. I was completely stunned, shouting: "It's my work, my manuscript, my paper finally! Give it to me, I don't want it published!"" And Polevoy, cynically, mocking, said: "It is not your decision to print or not to print. The manuscript will not be given to you, and we will print it as we see fit."

Then they explained to me that it wasn't an act of selfishness on their part or an accident. In my case, the manuscript had received an approval from the Central Committee itself, and now it was impossible *not* to publish it. If condemned in the Central Committee, again, the manuscript is needed to be considered "elsewhere." But then, in Polevoi's office, forgetting myself, I rushed into a fight, grabbed the manuscript, ran out onto to Vorovsky Street, ripped it and stuffed pieces of it into garbage cans up to the Arbat Square, cursing the day when I began to write.

Later, it was discovered that there was another copy in the *Youth* offices, or maybe several, including those copies reprinted for the Central Committee. The editors called me at home and told me that all of the editing had already been done, the new text is re-reprinted, and I'd better not look at it so was not to spoil my nerves.

Later it was found out that in *Youth* there was another copy, and maybe several, including those that were reprinted for the Central Committee. The editors called me home and said that all of the edits have already been done, the new text is re-reprinted, and I'd better not look so as not to spoil the nerves. When I met B Polevoy, he agreed to put the following on the first page:

"The novel is printed in abbreviated form."

I wrote a letter saying that I would sue. But, after thinking about it, I realized that the court would find a way to deny me, and at the same time everyone would say: "What do you want, because the editorial office itself declares that it publishes a novel in abbreviated form."

The latter somehow convinced me, again on the basis of the principle of "anything". And maybe people will be wary when they see the footnote and will look for meaning between the lines...

The manuscript, altered without me, went into a set, they sent me the proofs, I started to read them, and my eyes got darker, I remember, exactly, literally. I didn't know yet that it wasn't all. Then I continued to cut out the edges and turn them over, which I discovered only when I bought the magazine at the kiosk. And at the bottom there was a barely noticeable, a silent footnote saying "Magazine version" instead of the promised "Printed in abbreviated form"...

By that time I had a contract to publish the novel in a separate book with the Young Guard publishing house. There was still hope to restore something: the "full" book should be something different than the magazine version.

At once it became clear that the publishing house did not want additions; on the contrary, they demanded still new abbreviations. This is where the story began, only possible in the Soviet Union.

*Youth* magazine went abroad. And in many countries, the novel was translated immediately. I received a bewildered letter from the translators: they didn't understand many places.

For example, censorship reduced the novel to the point that there were no more arsonists in the chapter "Profession: Arsonists", not even a hint, not even a word is present. Only a few paragraphs are left about how the hero reads Pushkin.

Or: They cut out the guy playing an accordion, in the midst of a general retreat, half-heartedly playing a polka. But the repeated mention of him by mistake remained, and it is completely incomprehensible without the first mention. When Semerik's grandfather criticizes the Soviet regime, he calls the orders "Krakamedei" and that's been carved out; and elsewhere it's not clear what "Krakamedei" Grandfather is talking about again. And so on.

But, most importantly, translators requested the full text as opposed to the magazine variant, naively accepting *Youth's* footnote in a literal and serious sense. They sent requests officially through the State-run International Book Company (Mezhkniga). Neither I nor International Book knew what to answer.

Finally, somewhere at the top, it was decided to turn to the manuscript again. It was difficult to select thirty pages of typewritten text, which outside the context looked harmless, and after great difficulties, with the support of the foreign commission of the Writers' Union, "International Book" had to press censorship stamps on each of the pages &mdash; solely to prove to foreigners that the full text existed.

But while these pages roamed through the bureaucracy, foreign translations were released, and pages with censorship stamps were too late.


Then I took them to the Young Guard for publishing; These were the chapters "Profession: Arsonists", "Shards of the Empire", "Million rubles" (but again heavily cut), and a few pieces of other chapters. The publishing house didn't want to embed them for a long time. I argued: "Even abroad, they allow them," and they objected: "It may be allowed abroad, but that doesn't mean it's allowed in the USSR." Then they decided to insert them after all, but only if I softened the novel in other places and added ideologically seasoned paragraphs "for balance," the content of which the editors literally dictated to me.

Чтобы спасти кни­гу в целом, я дописывал. Иногда читаешь хорошую книгу советского писателя — и вдруг натыкаешься на места, такие безвкусные, «идейные», что плюнуть хочется. Автор их дописывал, отлично зная, что они вызовут только недоумение и презрение читателя, но далеко не все читатели знают, что только такой ценой могло выйти в свет произведение. Особенно ярко это проявляется в книгах стихов. Они должны открываться стихами дежурно-идейными, которыми автор зарабатывает право поместить дальше уже и подлинную поэзию. Поэтому многие читатели начи­нают читать сборники стихов с конца, т. е. с луч­шего.

To save the book as a whole, I finished writing. Sometimes you read a good book of the Soviet writer &mdash; and suddenly you stumble into places that are so tasteless, so "ideological," that you want to spit. The author has written them, knowing perfectly well that they will cause only bewilderment and contempt in the reader, but not all readers know that only having paid such a price could the work come into the light. This is especially evident in books of poetry. They open with the verses of the duty &mdash; ideological, with which the author then earns the right to follow with genuine poetry. Therefore many readers begin to read collections of verses from the end, i.e., from the best.

I always had to fight for every phrase, to bargain, to finish the idea. In the USSR, with its Jesuit publishing business, everything is confusing, difficult, any book is overgrown with layers and gaping with censorship holes. Publish in the magazine as much as you can, then in a separate book slowly add something, and in re-publication, add still a little more, but suddenly the situation changes, and what easily passed through in the past is today a terrible sedition, and vice versa.

And my manuscripts existed in at least two versions: the main &mdash; only for myself, deeply hidden, and another, for the press, which is provided a softened version.

The situation changed in the USSR just as Babi Yar was published as a separate novel. Competent people told me I was lucky with the book, another month or two, and it wouldn't have come out. The book suddenly aroused anger in the Central Committee of the Komsomol, and in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the publication of "Babi Yar" was generally recognized as a mistake, re-publication of the book was prohibited, libraries stopped issuing the book; a new wave of state anti-Semitism began.

I, however, still held on to my main manuscript. I continued to work on it, so to speak, "for myself and for the truth." I added back the reworked and improved pieces of Khreshchatyk, the Monastery, the disaster, added new facts, and now I didn't think about censorship, but the manuscript was such that I did not store it at home. My things were searched when I left, and once unknown persons set fire to my office and burned it down. I placed the most important manuscript on film, which I buried in an iron box near the house, and the manuscripts themselves I buried in glass jars in the forest near Tula, where I hope they still lie now.

In the summer of 1969, I escaped from the USSR, taking the films with me, including a film that contained "Babi Yar." I am releasing it as my first book without any political censorship &mdash; and I ask that only this text of "Babi Yar" be considered valid.

It brings together published work, discarded censorship, and post-publication writing, including the final stylistic polish. This, finally, is really what I wrote. But the main differences I decided to keep, and that's why.

For those who are interested, this can give you an idea of the conditions in which books are produced in the USSR. I emphasize once again: my example is not an exception, on the contrary, it is the most ordinary and typical. When reading a book by a Soviet author, always make adjustments for censorship, look for the idea between the lines.

Further, millions of copies of the censored text of "Babi Yar" was printed. People who read it, and would like to know the full text, will only need to read what is new in this edition, which is published for the first time. Especially since the selected texts contain the main meaning of the book for which it is written.

I must say that it wasn't so easy to isolate the texts. Should I count, as censored, what I have cut myself after the first manuscript was returned to me marked "anti-Soviet" with advice not to show anyone? No, obviously. It was self-censorship, forced, but self-censorship. Then I reworked and restored these pieces, but it's my business, and genuine censorship has not seen them.

Next, with which text to compare? The circulation of *Youth* is two million copies, *Young Guard's* circulation is 150,000. That is, the text of *Youth* is known to the majority of readers. Thirty typewritten pages were forcibly added by censorship, only due to foreign inquiries, reprinting is forbidden, and most importantly, all translations into other languages without exception were made only from *Youth.* I take this text as a sample of the censored edition.

The next challenge. Due to censorship cuts, sometimes logic required binding words, grammatical sentence rearranging. The editors did it, and a few more words that I particularly hated were added by Boris Poledoy.

Restoring the text, I removed these edits, and at the same time, I made stylistic improvements of the *Youth* text here and there. So if someone with a magazine in his hand checks the text letter by letter, he will find small discrepancies in some places, but do not reflect on the meaning at all. I think it would be too cumbersome to mark them. The main task I set for myself was to show really serious and fundamental censorship interference.


The differences in this publication are as follows:

The usual font &mdash; this was published by the magazine *Yunost* in 1966.

Italics &mdash; was cut or censored at the same time.

The brackets [] are additions made in 1967-60.

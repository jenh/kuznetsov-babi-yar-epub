## Looting is damned interesting, but you must know how to do it

The neighbor took the receipt up to the school, where the Germans had already set up their headquarters. I immediately chased after him, thinking: they'll give him German money, and I will ask him to see it.

I waited at the gate of the school. He stood there, in the courtyard, explaining the situation as he walked up to the door. Then I saw him fly out of it with a crash, waving his arms ridiculously. The soldiers shouted and unbolted their rifles. I was afraid they'd shoot and ran around the corner.

The troops still marched through the area, but there were fewer than before. From the vicinity of the bazaar, people ran in all directions and scattered like cockroaches, loaded down with stuffed sacks, faces flushed with excitement. Realizing that I was clearly missing out, I rushed to the bazaar.

I encountered a group robbing a large shoe shop. They'd smashed the showcase window, and people buzzed around it, busily elbowing each other, crunching the glass underfoot, aunties and uncles climbing all over each other. I rushed after them and managed to see them grab boxes of shoes and galoshes. My God, what fabulous goods they were for the time! But while I made my way, the shelves emptied, as if they were swept by the wind and the crowd started boiling over in a corner. I stopped and jumped on other people's backs, annoyed: well, that's it then, everything is right in front of my eyes, but I can’t reach it. Friends and lovers were already ripping bundles of shoelaces and boxes of shoe polish from each others' hands.

Then I jumped through the window and back onto the street, looking around: is there another, unlooted store? Oh, what a shame: while I was tossed about in the shoe store, the hardware store next to it was broken into and people were already dragging paint cans, bundles of shovels, and locks out of it.

I ran in, working my elbows to squeeze up to the counter, but I saw only the feet trampling the pannyi and chalk putty races. I noticed men knocking into the back room, climbed up, got in the door on the head, in the teeth. From the pain, I was brutalized, I fled and wedged between two men, they squeezed me so that my ribs crunched, but right in front of me was a broken box.

The new kerosene lamps, without glasses, lay in it, placed in the straw. I reached out, pushing away alien hands, grabbed one, the other — and the lamps were gone.

I was trembling, I realized that this is my booty-pah. But the store was empty, the robbers ran on. I ran out and almost roared: they broke “Haberdashery”, and she was still whole when I came here. It seems they were robbed by some women squealing, and the shop seemed to be going with a shake.

At this point I, like a young one, squirming, made my way there and grabbed a box from the shelf. The women pulled it from me, but I clung like a cat to meat, they shook my soul out of me, the box cracked, and simple black buttons for a coat fell from it. Dozens of hands began to rake these buttons, and I also frantically raked and poured them into my pockets, because I had all the rights to them all than others.

I noticed that clothes brushes rolled under my feet, began to catch them, fished out five pieces, but dropped one lamp, which I immediately grabbed from under my nose some vile woman

Crushed, I swayed, and went outside, where I caught sight of bags of salt being dragged out, but when I got closer, there was only paper and empty crates left.

I was ready to cry, I'd never been greedy, my grandmother was so well-mannered and I was such a polite grandson, but suddenly this robbery seized me like a hot avalanche, my throat squeezed with greed and excitement.

And, most importantly, I understood that it was a unique, rare case - so rich, so magnificent, so unpunished to rob. I missed it, I was a little late... Which means lack of experience. "Well, okay," I thought, comforting myself. - But the next time..." And when will he be, this next time?

Got the weight off the scales and carried it all home.

From the windows, people looked out of the gate. Pavel Sochava's neighbor said ironically all over the street:

- Here comes Tolya. Go tell your mother to whip you up.

I feel like I've been poured cold water. I was so proud to carry my lamp and brushes, and then I yanked into the yard, unloaded the prey in the hay... Mom ahnullah:

- What the hell is this?

Grandma looked at it, shook her head:

- Or don't we have a lamp, son? But my grandfather understood me and praised me:

- Here we go! Well done! The Bolsheviks themselves robbed the people and sold it to them, it's ours. Oh, I didn't know, I missed, ah, I missed!

Shatkovsky there has taken out half of the "Gastronoma" and rolled up a barrel of sunflower oil. What an occasion! We're the only ones who get robbed here.

Turns out, while I was at the bazaar, six soldiers came and demanded, "Egg, mile!" - went everywhere, like at home, took potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes...

Well, hell, look what's going on. Some people are robbing there, others are robbing there. Business!

I was still shaking with excitement and my grandfather's praise, I ran to call Shurka Matsu, we both went back to the market. It was already empty. No matter how much we looked at it, nothing, no matter how broomy we saw it, the shops are covered with paper, straw and glass. In the shoe store, we climbed into the register, started turning the handle. They beat up checks for thousands of roubles, went out, threw them in the street and, already indifferent, watched as everyone enters the city and the troops enter.

There were tractors, all-terrain vehicles, columns of soldiers riding bicycles and wagons on simple carts. The ones that came in and went in were wearing knots with junk, overcoats thrown over their shoulders.

The wind rose, drove the straw and paper, carried the smoke from the cars, the armies went on, clouded, and there was no end to them, and everything was in order, like locusts, to pull something. A quiet, seemingly normal, prosaic robbery... It was Friday, September 19, 1941.

SO, WE'RE IN THIS NEW LIFE

KIEV IN THE HANDS OF GERMAN TROOPS

Führer's main apartment " September 20

Supreme Command

The German Armed Forces reports

Along with the operations to surround the Soviet armies in the east, an offensive was launched against the capital of Ukraine - Kiev. After a brave breakthrough of strong fortifications on the western bank of the Dnieper our troops entered the city. A German military banner has been waving over the citadel of Kiev since this morning.

The offensive operations east of the Dnieper are moving forward irresistibly. In the battles for the fortification of Leningrad, we have made great strides...

*) "Ukrainska Slovo" (Word of the Word), September 21, 1941. Newspaper in Ukrainian, published by the occupation authorities.

By the time the Germans took over Kiev, the newspaper "Ukrayinskoe Slovo" (Ukrainian Word) had published its fifteenth issue, first published in Zhytomyr. It was either sold or distributed in the streets by triumphant enthusiasts, its grandfather got it as he brought it and wanted to read it.

But he was not strong enough to read small print, and even on crappy, like wrapping paper, and he entrusted this case to me, listening to me, philosophically comprehending it.

I only bring headlines from this paper:

Birth of the Church in Kiev, a poem by Yakov Nagorny.

...Here I'll make a traditional retreat and at least briefly tell you about our little family: who we were, what we were, and why.

I can't stand such retreats in books myself, I skip them, and if you find my retreat uninteresting, you can skip it too, because the main thing in this book is much further.

But if you're wondering how a man dreams of Hitler, at least read about my grandfather.

Fyodor Vlasovich, my grandfather, hated the Soviet power with all his soul and was eagerly waiting for the Germans as deliverers, believing that nothing could be worse than the Soviet power in the world.

No, he was not a fascist or monarchist, nationalist or Trotskyite, red or white, he didn't know a damn thing about it.

He was originally from the Ukrainian serfs, a poor peasant. In terms of social status, it's a long-serving city worker. In essence, he is the simplest, smallest, hungriest, most frightened and frightened citizen of the Country of Soviets, who is his stepmother.

His grandfather was born in 1870 - in the same year as Lenin, but that was the end of the same thing between them. Grandfather could not hear the name of Lenin, although he died long ago, as many Leninists died or were killed. He believed that it was Lenin who was the cause of all the troubles, that he "played Russia like a roulette, lost everything and died.

When he said such things, grandmother looked around in horror and shouted in the yard:

- Stop the grinding, you little bastard. Good people are dying, and you, the parasite, are still alive.

His grandfather was born and raised in the village of Shenderovka, Kanevskiy district, in some desperate rural family with eleven children, who, according to him, lived in a dilapidated kurin.

He spent his youth in prison with German colonists in the Kherson region, leaving his family behind forever. After serving in the soldiers, he went to Kiev to earn money, hang out in search of work, was a janitor at the general's house, married a laundress, went to the tram as a conductor and dreamed about his house and prosperity: so that one could eat and not think about tomorrow - that was the limit of his dreams.

They and their grandmothers were starving, getting cold, adding a penny to a penny, ruining their youth, but they finally bought a tiny piece of swamp on Kurenevka, drained it themselves, built a hut themselves for a long time - and then the revolution broke out.

She didn't bring any good, just a new hunger, fear - and she took away her dream. His grandfather did not believe the Bolsheviks' beautiful words about earthly paradise in the foggy future. He was a practitioner.

For many years then my grandfather worked at shoe factory No. 4 as a plumber, climbed the pipes in a stinking robot with keys, and was injured at the machine - such a working class that there is nowhere else to go. And all these years, he has not ceased to hate the power of "these bosses and murderers" and "no, not the masters".

His, a former peasant, was finally horrified by the collectivization of her collective farms, which caused an unprecedented famine. The construction of factories, noisily painted in those years by Dniproges, the conquest of the North Pole there or the sky - were resolutely "to the point of lightning".

The North Pole was conquered, but when my grandfather and grandmother finally got their rainbow dream - a cow, it had nothing to feed. The queues for mixed fodder were like a cloud. Next to the hut, behind the railroad embankment, a huge rich meadow disappears, and you can't graze. No matter how dodgy grandfather was, whoever he fought to get the hay! I searched Yaram Babi and Yaram Repyahov with a bag and sickle, carefully cut the grass under the fences. I didn't drink milk myself, I sent my grandmother to the market to sell it. I remembered that the German baron had a cow who gave three buckets of milk a day, and thought that if our husky Lysku feed, maybe she would give as much as she did.

Anyway, he was a great combinator. And from the constant failures, the convulsive poverty became disgusting and jealous of the extraordinary. Jealous of half of Kurenevka, especially those who had a good vegetable garden and who could carry baskets to the radish bazaar. Kurenevka has always been saved by radish, as well as pigs and chickens, deaf to all sciences, arts or politics, or rather, demanding in politics one thing: to be allowed to sell radish.

Bitter in "Childhood" has a song like that:

One beggar hanged up the spoilers to dry,

And the other beggar portie stole it.

So my grandfather was jealous. But he couldn't reach the real Kurenev's "gourds": his garden could be measured with his palms, stripes of steps eight wide, at the hut and barn. Behind the fence there were collective garden gardens. One night my grandfather dug up new holes and moved the fence by half a meter, stealing five square meters of land from gardeners, and the indifferent collective farm authorities did not notice it! Grandfather was in a great mood for a week and triumphed, making plans, how in a few years he will move the fence again by half a meter.

By his old age, he had become terribly naughty, sneaking off the neighbor's pears hanging over the fence to "his land", killing neighbor's chickens with a stick if they were wading to us, and so he had quarreled with the whole street.

When he was spitting, you could hear him say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - and his nickname was "Seven-true-two-two-three-buckets-milk."

My grandfather did not drink vodka with stinginess, did not smoke, did not go to the movies, tried to ride the tram with a hare, pants and jackets to the point that they were riding and crawling on it. If he was driving down the street with a haystack and lost a bunch, his grandfather was the first to be on the pavement, carefully raking a bunch of bits with a stick and solemnly carrying them home.

The cow didn't pay off, so I had to sell it.

My grandfather tried ducks, and we went to the pond with him, hanging out there with a basket of dragons, picking up a "cassock" to feed them, but bony, hairy ducks grew on the cassock.

Grandfather switched to chickens: they walk, buckle and feed themselves. The chickens were starving, pinching the seedlings in the bed, and they didn't want to go. Got the piglets started so they wouldn't be washed and washed. Grandfather's piglets grew long legged, muscular, fried like hounds. And just before the Germans arrived, both piglets fell ill and died. I had to bury it.

His grandfather was very energetic, fighting and pushing all day from dawn to darkness, but he couldn't get rich.

There were people around who "lived": party members, security officers, thieves, snitches, various trade unionists. Rolled out in public cars, bellied at Caucasian resorts, received secret salaries in envelopes. Grandfather, for his terrible climbing through the sewers, received half as much salary as he did for a simple suit. And in his entire life, he didn't have a suit, and he died without wearing a suit.

But there were people who looked at the life of their grandfather's family as a paradise. In collective farms around Kiev, peasants worked as if they were serfs. No, worse. When the landlord was a serf, he left them days to work for himself, on his little field. And in the collective farm, a man did not have days like this, nor did he have a field. For going to work he was put in the list of sticks - "workday", and in the autumn something paid, or maybe not paid, or paid one penny for the workday.]

So when the guest came, my grandfather had only one topic to talk about: how the old days were good, and people were fed up, and rich, and the Bolsheviks destroyed everything.

But when, in 1937, his old friend, the old Beetle, was arrested for a stupid joke told in line, and the Beetle immediately went missing, as he drowned, his grandfather was frightened, closed, and he had only half a topic, that is, as in the old days was good.

I suppose he was as right as he was wrong. That's the most "good" of all. It's only in comparison. And to my poor grandfather in 1937, tsarist Russia seemed to be a just, lost paradise.

For some reason, he did not remember his father's hen, who rented a piece of foreign land, but remembered how well the general lived and how generous he was. What were the prices under the tsar: the bun cost five kopecks, herring two kopecks, and nobody wanted to look at the voblya.

Now he told about his hatred for Bolsheviks only to God, standing before the icons on his knees for a long time, and whispered, whispered and passionately told them something: he knew that somebody would listen and God would not sell.

Soon after the beginning of the war, a German leaflet fell on our roof and stuck by the pipe with morning dew. My grandfather saw me, put the stairs on and sent me out to get me. I barely took off the scattered leaflet, and we started reading.

In the leaflet it was written that Germany was called upon to destroy the Bolsheviks and to establish a new, fair order, when "he who does not work, he does not eat", but "everyone who works honestly, gets what he deserves". That life on the liberated land is beautiful: oil costs ten kopecks a pound, bread - seven kopecks, herring - three.

Grandpa's got eyes on his forehead. It was a message to him personally.

He memorized the flyer, but then he ripped it to shreds. He was in his seventy-second year, and his dream is crazy! - and maybe his cow will still be grazing in the meadow, giving him three buckets of milk, and there will be a supply of food in the house, for tomorrow and even the day after tomorrow, and maybe he will even buy his first suit.

SEMERIC (DOLGORUK's maiden name) Marfa Efimovna, my grandmother, was born and grew up in the village of Deremezna, Obukhovsky district, in a cursed hulupa, where, like in a grandfather's family, there was nowhere to spit because of the children.

The childhood of the great Ukrainian poet from the serfs of Taras Shevchenko was held in such a hulup:

I don't call it paradise.

Moi's in there spilling slugs,

Well, you're the one who loves evil,

He didn't live in your Hathi.]

There were so many of them there, a grandmother's kin, in Deremeznen, and in Peregonovka, and in Kiev "for hire", that I never figured out how many of them, who I have to: Hopper and Conon, Ganna and Nina, Thomas and foolish Katka ... Sometimes they'd come, their grandmother would feed them, give them an old skirt, and give them trampled rolls.

Only the fool Katya, I knew she was my cousin. After the typhus she fell into dementia, became a beggar, she sat with suma under the churches, asked for bread in the yards, brought pieces of bread in the suma, grandfather threw himself and took away for piglets, muttering: "To think, these poor people live here, and how much do they get for Easter?"

I loved her, Katya, she was like a saint, harmless and kind. If she was served candy, she would definitely save it for me, and sometimes buy me a hotel - a clay whistle horse - at the bazaar for the collected kopecks. I grew up, and she didn't notice it, brought whistles and mumbled and mumbled... She died in the street, quietly and imperceptibly, as the sparrows die, she was loaded on a cart and buried somewhere.

Twelve years my grandmother went into people, nursed other people's children, was a maid, then became a laundress. As much as I asked, she never wanted to remember her youth or love, maybe because she remembered one thing.

She was completely illiterate. I didn't even know the numbers. She could tell the difference between paper money by drawing and color, and coins by size.

Since my mother, the teacher, worked two shifts at school and stayed after school, I grew up with my grandmother. She woke me up, washed, fed, beat me, amused me with Ukrainian "kazochkami", and all she stomped, boiled, interfered, pushed, made a piglet, drove a cat, bent on the beds, stabbed wood, and she constantly had a lower backache, so that she lay down from time to time, moaned quietly, then went up and started working again.
